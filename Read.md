# Multi-Level Cache Simulator (C++)

## Overview
A C++ simulator modeling L1/L2/L3 cache hierarchy using LRU eviction,
with comparison between direct-mapped and fully associative caches.

## Features
- Multi-level cache hierarchy (L1, L2, L3)
- LRU eviction policy
- Direct-mapped vs fully associative cache comparison
- Hit/miss statistics and AMAT calculation
- Input-driven workload simulation



## How to Run
g++ cache_simulator.cpp -o cache
./cache
